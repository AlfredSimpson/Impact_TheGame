# Impact_TheGame
A simple 3D game made in Unity

This game was made for IT201 at NJIT. It started out as Rollaball, and then progressed with modifications.

Eventually, that game became this.

I've removed most of the material shoved here, but you can always check past commits. For now, if you want to see my scripts or just play the game:
